## üß† Working Principle

The system detects microplastics using **multi-sensor fusion** ‚Äî combining data from optical, vibration, and TDS sensors for more accurate results.

### 1. **Optical Detection**
- A **white or laser LED** shines light through a transparent water container.  
- Two LDR sensors are placed:
  - **Front LDR**: Detects how much light passes through.
  - **Side LDR**: Detects scattered light from microplastic particles.  
- Microplastics scatter and block light, reducing the signal to the LDRs.

### 2. **Vibration Detection**
- The **SW-420 sensor** is placed below or on the side of the container.  
- It senses tiny vibrations caused by floating microplastics in the water.

### 3. **TDS Detection**
- The **TDS sensor** is placed inside the water.  
- Measures **total dissolved solids** (salts, minerals, and pollutants).  
- Sudden changes in TDS levels indicate contamination.

### 4. **Data Fusion & Decision**
- Arduino reads values from all sensors.
- A logic algorithm compares readings to set thresholds.
- Based on sensor values:
  - üü¢ **Green LED** ‚Üí Clean water  
  - üü° **Yellow LED** ‚Üí Slight pollution (few microplastics)  
  - üî¥ **Red LED + Buzzer** ‚Üí High microplastic content
